ðŸš— Real-Time Vehicle Detection Using OpenCV and Haar Cascades
Welcome to the Vehicle Detection System, a Python-based project that demonstrates how to detect and count vehicles from video footage using the power of OpenCV and Haar Cascade classifiers. This application provides a real-time visual interface that identifies vehicles within each frame, outlines them with bounding boxes, and updates the count dynamically as the video plays.

The project is designed for developers, students, and researchers who are interested in learning about computer vision, video analysis, or traffic monitoring systems. Using a pre-trained model (haarcascade_car.xml), it enables fast and efficient detection of cars without the need for extensive training or external dependencies.

Whether you're analyzing traffic flow, building a smart city prototype, or simply learning how object detection works, this project provides a clean, easy-to-understand implementation that's perfect for hands-on experimentation.

âœ¨ Key Highlights
ðŸ“¹ Detects cars from a pre-recorded video or live webcam stream

ðŸŸ© Draws bounding boxes around detected vehicles in real time

ðŸ”¢ Displays a live vehicle count per frame

ðŸ§  Uses a pre-trained Haar cascade XML classifier

âš¡ Lightweight, fast, and easy to modify for your own use
